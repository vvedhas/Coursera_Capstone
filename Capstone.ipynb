        "Toronto, the capital of Ontario, Canada, is Canadaâ€™s most populous city. Located in a geographically diverse area, Toronto is famous for its valleys, forests and mountains. While the primary language for communication is English, Toronto boasts over 160 different languages.\n",

Some of the data we shall use will be Boroughs, Neighborhoods, and Postcodes. These attributes can be scraped from the webpage tables, and can be cleaned up using the BeautifulSoup Library.\n",
